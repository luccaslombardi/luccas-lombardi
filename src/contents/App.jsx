          I'm a self-taugh student full stack web development ðŸ’» from SÃ£o Paulo
          - Brazil. I was a Computer Science student at Universidade SÃ£o Judas
          Tadeu in SÃ£o Paulo and I participated in several Frontend and Backend
          Development events, almost always performed by Rocketseat ðŸš€.
          Currently my main hobby is to create autonomous projects using ReactJs
          and NodeJs, always keep learning about new technologies and good
          programming practices. I also always seek to improve myself in the
          technologies that I already know and improve my knowledge about tools.
